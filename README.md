## What is this?

For now, it's [10 PRINT](https://10print.org/) recreated with [Processing](https://processing.org/).
Character count **(185/256)**

It doesn't scroll once it's full (yet?!) and takes a few seconds to print out the whole grid, but it seems to be pretty faithful to the original program! A lot of the length comes from a different approach to drawing the maze walls as I drew lines rather than using ASCII characters. I'm not sure which one is more efficient as I only knew how to draw lines and have yet to try converting to ASCII characters.

I'll probably try my hand at a [Gingerbread Man Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingerbreadman_map), they look pretty cool! Shoutouts to the challenge page for linking to the [Dwitter](https://www.dwitter.net/) website which brought it to my attention in the first place, they seem to be pretty popular there.

There's a feature-length novel within my code that's sure to be a New York Times Bestseller documenting my fall into insanity while writing and future plans for the program if anyone cares at all.
