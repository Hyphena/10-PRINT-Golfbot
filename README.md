*"Brevity is the soul of great code"*‚ÄîShakespeare (pretty sure).

Ever tried code golf? The game is to use as few characters as possible to do as much as possible.

We're starting out easy with 256 characters‚Äîand in the final week, we're dropping it down to 128 characters.

Start practicing your putting, and share what your entry with other challengers to see if they can make it even shorter.

## ‚õ≥Ô∏è What can you do?

Well, anything‚Äîand very little.

Looking for inspiration? [10Print](https://10print.org/) is a lovely little program that's just 38 characters long but generates infinite possibilities. We've love this program so much we've incorporated it into our site design; go [here](https://noopschallenge.com/10print) for a full, animated version of 10print.

There are active communities dedicated to Code Golf, like [Dwitter](https://www.dwitter.net/) (demos less than 140 characters), [codegolf.stackexchange.com](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/), and [r/codegolf](https://www.reddit.com/r/codegolf/).

## ‚ú® A few ideas

## ü§ñ How it works
